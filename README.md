# Real Estate Tokenization

## Project Description

Real Estate Tokenization is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that enables the fractional ownership of real estate properties through tokenization. By leveraging smart contracts on the blockchain, this platform allows property owners to tokenize their real estate assets, dividing them into tradeable shares that can be bought, sold, and transferred by multiple investors.

The platform democratizes real estate investment by lowering the barrier to entry, enabling investors to own fractions of high-value properties without requiring substantial capital. Each property is represented as an NFT (ERC-721) with 1,000 divisible shares, allowing for precise fractional ownership and seamless trading.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the real estate industry by making property investment accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial capacity. We aim to create a transparent, secure, and efficient marketplace where real estate assets can be easily tokenized, traded, and managed on the blockchain.

We envision a future where:
- Real estate investment is democratized and accessible to all
- Property ownership is transparent and verifiable on the blockchain
- Liquidity in real estate markets is significantly improved
- Global investors can participate in local real estate markets
- Transaction costs and intermediaries are minimized through smart contracts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Core Testnet 2 tokens for deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd real-estate-tokenization
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your private key and other configurations
```

4. Compile contracts:
```bash
npm run compile
```

5. Deploy to Core Testnet 2:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Usage

After deployment, you can interact with the contract using the following functions:

- **tokenizeProperty(location, totalValue)**: Tokenize a new property
- **purchaseShares(propertyId, shares)**: Buy shares of a property
- **transferShares(propertyId, to, shares)**: Transfer shares to another user

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

## Contract Architecture

The main contract `Project.sol` includes:
- Property struct for storing property information
- ShareHolding struct for tracking ownership history
- Mapping structures for efficient data retrieval
- Three core functions for tokenization, purchasing, and transferring
- Administrative functions for property management
- View functions for querying contract state
